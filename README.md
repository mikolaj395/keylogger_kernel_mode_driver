# Kernel Mode Windows Keylogger
The aim of this project is to explore the subject of Windows drivers and keyboard-OS communication.
As a result a kernel mode keyboard driver, which saves all keystrokes to file, has been created. 
This code is based on kbfiltr Keyboard Class Filter Driver published at https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples

## Installation
Before installation you have to enable test signing on your machine and sign driver with certificate generated by Visual Studio. Then the driver hes to be installed. Devcon tool can be used to do so. During installation it is recommended to specify PS/2 keyboard as the device. It is recommended to run this driver only in a virtual environment istead of your main machine.

## Debugging
Windows drivers debugging is not a trivial task. The possibility to print messages from driver code can be very helpful. In order to see such messages DebugView tool (from WDK package) can be used.
